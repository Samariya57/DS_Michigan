In order to be successful in this course you need to know how to program in Python. If you have a strong programming background already, the first week will introduce you to the Python programming language, and help you learn important constructs (such as slicing of arrays, and lambda functions) which you might not be used to. If you do not have a strong programming background, or you want to refresh your understanding of Python, we highly recommend the Coursera course Programming for Everybody, taught by our colleague Dr. Chuck Severance.
